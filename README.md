# Project Zomboid RP Mod Prototype

Prototype of a Roleplay (RP) mod for **Project Zomboid**.

This project is an experimental modification that extends the base game with additional roleplay-oriented mechanics and systems.  
It is designed as a foundation for building structured RP gameplay features.

## About

This repository contains Lua scripts structured as a standard Project Zomboid mod.

The goal of this prototype is to:

- Experiment with RP-focused mechanics
- Extend player interaction systems
- Introduce additional gameplay logic on top of vanilla mechanics
- Provide a base architecture for future RP systems

This is not a finished mod — it is a technical prototype.
